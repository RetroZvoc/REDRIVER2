# Compiling
Project **must** be built only for **32 bit** platform because there are 32 bit pointers everywhere (and use of *long* which with GCC can be a 64 bit numbers)

First use [premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/releases/download/v5.0.0-alpha15/premake-5.0.0-alpha15-windows.zip) to generate project files.

Dependencies (links for Windows):
- [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.12-VC.zip)
- [OpenAL-Soft](https://openal-soft.org/openal-binaries/openal-soft-1.20.1-bin.zip)
- [JPEG](http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9d.zip)

#### Before running premake ####
You need to download all the dependencies and extract them.
After set next environment variables like:
```
SDL2_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\SDL2-2.0.12
OPENAL_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\openal-soft-1.20.1-bin
JPEG_DIR = <your_dependency_folder>\jpeg-9d
```

*JPEG* itself needs to be configured - go to your *JPEG_DIR* folder and rename `jconfig.xx` (proper one for your platform) to `jconfig.h`. 
For *Windows / Visual Studio* you need to choose `jconfig.vc`

Next you need to run `premake5 <target IDE>`, see premake documentation;
Or just run `gen_vc2019.bat` (Windows only)

#### Markers for decompiled function names, code, etc

- [D] = decompiled
- [T] = debugged and tested
- [A] = altered code - debugging purposes or not being able to compile or run.... Can be used anywhere in the code, structures etc
